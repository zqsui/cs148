 Assignment 1: CHECK 
 code works properly, but need to create branches (not subdirectories) for individual assignments for completion checks
 a check can be granted once proper branch is in place 
 github will translate 'Assignment 1' into 'Assignment-1'. Please use 'Assignment-X' for branching of Assignment X
 branch lables are case sensitive
 comment: branch now found properly 
 
 Assignment 2: CHECK 
 good work 
 
 Assignment 3: CHECK 
 comment: servo overstiff, with overshooting and minor oscillation
 
 Assignment 4: UNCHECKED
 error: only base link displayed for test cases
 error: controls incorrectly applied; not zeroing after iteration?
 error: quaternion rotation error for urdf_example test
 regrade: robots displayed properly; quaternion rotation working; base control goes unstable
